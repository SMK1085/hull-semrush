## Overview

Hull Connector for Semrush

This connector allows you to enrich Hull profiles with analytics data from Semrush.

Please refer to the end-user documentation for further details, see [Connector Docs](./assets/readme.md).

## Usage

After installing dependencies via

```console
npm i
```

you can use the `build` script from `package.json` to build the JS files or start the live development server running

```console
npm run start-src--watch
```

For convenience the script section contains a script to run `ngrok` and provide a tunnel to your local environment. Make sure to have [ngrok](https://ngrok.com/) installed and then run

```console
npm run ngrok
```

If you are not on a paid ngrok plan, you can run `ngrokfree` which doesn't use a dedicated subdomain.

To run a clustered version of the connector for production, use

```console
npm run start
```
